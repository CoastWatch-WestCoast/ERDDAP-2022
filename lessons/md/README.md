## ERDDAP Tutorial
These exercises are materials for the NOAA Satellite Training Course offered each year by regional nodes of NOAA's CoastWatch program. They demonstrate the features of the ERDDAP data servers and hands-on training on how to use the feature. Participants will subset and download data, create mapped images, visualize wind vector fields, and generate timeseries and Hovmöller diagrams.
